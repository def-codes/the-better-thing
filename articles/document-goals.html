    <p>
      This project will create an HTML document that offers the following
      capabilities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the document does the expected thing for common actions</li>
      <li>the foundation is sufficient to build more powerful tools</li>
      <li>the mechanisms used support persistence and portability</li>
      <li>
        support a modular form of composition using external resources
      </li>
      <li>
        support the breaking up of script execution units into physical pieces
      </li>
      <li>
        whatever code is needed to get this up and running can be “tucked away”
        into a section (like an appendix) of this document that is normally
        hidden.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Most of these features have some analog in literate programming systems
      such as Emacs' <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>.
