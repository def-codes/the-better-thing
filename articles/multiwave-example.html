  <h2>MultiWave voltage</h2>
  <p>Intent: view the voltage of a MultiWave device</p>
  <p>
    Need to know the location of the device interface. Suppose one is reachable
    at <a href="">http://localhost:1234/</a>
  </p>
  <p>Comes from register <code>0x0017</code></p>
  <p>
    then we would issue an HTTP <code>POST</code>request to
    <code>http://localhost:1234/readreg</code> with the payload
    <code>0x0017</code>
  </p>

      <div>
        <span property="rdf:value" class="value">115</span>
        <span property="qudt:??" class="units">Volts</span> (the actual value)
      </div>
      <div>
        ideal range (should span from x1 to x2 where x1 is min good voltage and
        x2 is max good voltage)
      </div>
      <div>
        full range (should span from xb1 to xb2 where xb1 is min representable
        voltage (lowest you'd ever expect to see) and xb2 is same for max)
      </div>
