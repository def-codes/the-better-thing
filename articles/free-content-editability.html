      <h3>Free content editability</h3>
    </summary>

    <p>
      The web platform includes a built-in way to make elements editable. The
      global
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable"
        ><code>contenteditable</code></a
      >
      attribute (which controls the boolean
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/contentEditable"
        ><code>contentEditable</code></a
      >
      interface property) indicates that “the user” (that's you) should be able
      to type in the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Making a <code>style</code> block <code>contenteditable</code> will
      immediately reflect changes that you make. (Tested in Firefox, Chrome, and
      Edge.)
    </p>

    <p>Go ahead, try it.</p>

    <style contenteditable="true">
      body {
        color: black; /* edit this to set the document's default text color */
      }
    </style>

    <p>
      You can also make <code>script</code> tags editable. However, they are
      <em>not</em> re-evaluated when edited.
    </p>

    <script contenteditable="true">
      console.log("mind blown");
    </script>

    <p>
      Most elements, including <code>style</code>, will inherit the
      <code>contentEditable</code> property, all the way up to the
      <code>html</code> (document). Some elements (to wit, <code>title</code>)
      do not inherit this property, but are only editable when they are
      explicitly marked as such.
    </p>

          <h4>Indicating when elements are editable</h4>
        </summary>

        <p>
          How can you tell when something is editable, other than trying it?
        </p>

        <p>
          If the browser lets you put your cursor into a regular text element
          (i.e. a place that is not a text input), then it's editable.
        </p>

        <p>
          It would be useful if we could provide additional visual cues that
          something can be edited. Here is a rule that targets elements with the
          <code>contenteditable</code> property set.
        </p>

        <style contenteditable="true">
          [contenteditable=""],
          [contenteditable="true"] {
            background-color: #ffc;
          }
        </style>

        <p>
          (Note that “enumerated” attributes are enabled when the value is
          <code>true</code> or the empty string.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Because <code>contenteditable</code> is inherited (in most cases), we
          cannot reliably indicate editability on individual elements using CSS.
          CSS can only target <em>explicit attribute values</em>, not
          <em>effective property values</em>. However, we can use a CSS property
          that is itself inherited (such as <code>background-color</code>).
        </p>

        <p>
          Editability can also be turned <em>off</em>. To prevent non-editable
          elements from inheriting the indicator, we can reset them to their
          initial value.
        </p>

        <style contenteditable="true">
          [contenteditable=""] [contenteditable="false"],
          [contenteditable="true"] [contenteditable="false"] {
            background-color: white;
          }
        </style>

        <p>
          It's not sufficient to set the color to
          <code>initial</code>, as this is transparent and the parent's
          background color will still show through.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <p contenteditable="true">
            You can change me. And you can change me.
            <em contenteditable="false">But you cannot change me so easily.</em>
            For my part, I am also of the changeable type. In fact, while you
            cannot make edits to that text <em>per se</em>, you can select
            across the editable regions and delete it. I don't know whether this
            is intentional.
