      <h3>On on Microsoft Edge's lack of “Save”, and the people’s
      response</h3>

    <p>By 2015, thousands of <a

    users were reporting that the browser lacked a “Save” option</a>.  Before
    being locked by the moderators, that thread attracted 418 replies, including
    the following plaintive remarks:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>What's the point of being able to highlight, or write on a page unless
      it can be saved and sent to someone? The only way I can make this work is
      to "print screen" then edit in a photo editing program, save as a jpg for
      email. What a bad workaround.</p>

    <p>As this situation had not changed by 2017, third-party sites were coming
    to users’ rescue by offering ad-riddled articles such as <a

    to save web pages to disk using Edge browser in Windows 10”</a>, whose
    proposed solution is to print the page to a Document Format that is
    actually... Portable:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Does anyone see the fundamental problem with this? If I’m viewing a
      text file I have to print and save as pdf. Then use adobe to save as text
      file? Or even worse, open with Internet Explorer? What next, use Xcopy?
      Grip? Really? Let’s go back to IBM mainframes…. Sorry, I’m not a Microsoft
      hater, but this is Microsoft arrogance at its greatest. What happened to
      improving the user experience? No one at Microsoft ever had to save an
      Internet file?</p>

    <p>These grievances (whose “workarounds” reminded me of a <a

    express just how painfully our computing platform fails to meet basic
    expectations of portability.</p>
