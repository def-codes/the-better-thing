      <h3>protocols and documents</h3>
    </summary>

    <p>
      We can get at documents in two main ways: through hosts or through files.
      These correspond to <em>protocols</em>. The <code>http://</code> and
      <code>https://</code> protocols are used to access documents on hosts.
      Files are accessed using the <code>file://</code> protocol. Any file that
      you
    </p>

    <p>
      We identify a <em>hosted</em> environment as one which is served over HTTP
      or HTTPS.
    </p>

    <p>
      Strictly speaking, we can't know anything for sure about the accessibility
      of any hostâ€”certainly not from within the document.
    </p>

    <p>We have to rely on certain assumptions.</p>

    <p>
      We identify two kinds of hosts: global and local. Most of the time, you
      will get documents from a global host.
    </p>

    <p>
      A host with a local name (particularly <code>localhost</code>) is probably
      tied to the environment where the document is being viewed. Anything that
      the document depends on from such hosts <em>will</em> be unavailable as
      soon as the document is in another environment.
    </p>

    <p>Certain capabilities are available only in hosted environments.</p>
