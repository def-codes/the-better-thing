      <h3>Markup languages <i>versus</i> programming languages</h3>
    </summary>

    <p>
      Perhaps the most wonderful thing about HTML is that what you write is
      <em>visible by default</em>. Whatever you type will be output (more or
      less) as you typed it. For example, an HTML file containing nothing but
      the following eleven characters
    </p>

    <pre>hello world</pre>

    <p>
      will, when opened in a web browser, display the text “hello world” as
      expected. Here,
      <a
        target="_blank"
        download="hello-world.html"
        href="data:text/html, hello world"
      >
        try it</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      More realistically, look at the code for this section's opening paragraph:
    </p>

    <pre>
 &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most wonderful thing about HTML is that what you
    write is &lt;em&gt;visible by default&lt;/em&gt;.  Whatever you type will be
    output (more or less) as you typed it.  For example, an HTML file containing
    nothing but the following eleven bytes&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <aside>
      <b>Note:</b> You can use “view source” in your browser to see the markup
      for this entire document.
    </aside>

    <p>
      Most of the text is displayed as-is, just like writing on paper. This is
      true generally of “markup” languages. You have to go out of your way to
      switch to a mode where text is not taken literally. (In the case of HTML,
      the notorious “angle brackets” are the signal.)
    </p>

    <p>
      This “literal” quality is also true of spreadsheets: just about anything
      you type into a spreadsheet cell will be displayed in the cell just as you
      typed it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This see-what-you-typed quality of markup languages may be hard to
      appreciate until you've used something that <em>doesn't</em> work that
      way—such as nearly every programming language.
    </p>

    <p>
      In “programming” languages, by contrast, the code that you provide is
      <em>not</em> displayed, only interpreted. You have to go out of your way
      to produce output.
    </p>

    <p>
      People find markup languages much more intuitive than programming
      languages. No doubt this quality is a major reason for the web's initial
      success. Invisiblity is the <em>exception</em> rather than the rule.

      <h4>Invisible elements in HTML</h4>

      <p>
        Still, there are exceptions. In HTML, all “tags” (such as the
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags indicating “paragraph”) are themselves
        invisible, as are their attributes. Instead, the tags impact
        <em>how</em>
        the text content is displayed. (More strictly speaking, markup helps
        <em>classify</em> the content, which in turn can subject the content to
        special display rules.)
      </p>

      <p>
        But for some HTML elements, even the <em>content</em> is invisible by
        default. These elements include the document <code>head</code> (and
        everything inside it, such as <code>title</code>, <code>link</code>,
        <code>meta</code>, etc), <code>style</code>, and <code>script</code>, as
        well as some newer elements like <code>template</code> (whose main
        purpose is to support the “semantic” inclusion of content that is used
        only by scripts).
      </p>

      <p>
        Considering that some of these invisible elements—particularly
        <code>style</code> and <code>script</code>—are the only way to format
        the document or model changes to it, bringing these elements to light is
        clearly a first step in making any dynamic document system. (<a
