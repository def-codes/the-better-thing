      <h3>On the lost persistence of contenteditable</h3>
    </summary>

    <p>
      I am quite sure that it used to be the case, that when you would save a
      document wherein you had made changes to content-editable elements, those
      changes would be included in the saved version.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, as of this writing, those browsers that that still have a
      “Save” feature do <em>not</em> include changes that you made to editable
      elements. This is true regardless of whether you save the page as
      “Complete” or “HTML only” (the claims in
      <a href="https://superuser.com/a/823165">this post</a> notwithstanding. It
      appears that browsers did save changes to contenteditable elements as
      recently as 2014 (<a
        href="https://www.encodedna.com/2014/03/convert-your-browser-into-a-notepad-html5-contenteditable.htm"
        >as described here</a
      >), but this is no longer the case in any browser I have.)
