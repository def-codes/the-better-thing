      <h3>Free persistence</h3>
    </summary>
    
    <p>By “persistence,” I mean “portability”: the ability to preserve the
    document in whatever state it's in, pick it up, take it somewhere else, and
    pick up where you left off.  For that, we get nothing at all for free from
    the browser.  Even worse: we get a problem.</p>

      <h4>The “Save” problem</h4>
      
      <p>Once upon a time, browsers had a built-in “Save” feature, and that
      “Save” feature would include changes that the user had made to <a
      href="#free-content-editability">content-editable elements</a>.</p>

      <p>That is no longer the case.  As of 2019, <a
      href="#edge-no-save">Microsoft Edge does not have a “Save” feature at
      all</a>, and browsers that do <a href="#lost-free-persistence">do not
      preserve your edits</a>.</p>

      <aside>I have not checked for a “Save” feature in Safari, or on any mobile
      browsers.</aside>

      <p>In a way, it would be better if browsers <em>didn't</em> have a
      built-in save.  It creates certain expectations, yet it's not a standard
      and we (authors) can't control what it does.  In that sense, Edge is the
      first browser to get this right.</p>
      
      <p>As such, the problem becomes, how do we deal with the expectations
      created by a built-in “Save” feature when it does exist?</p>
