      <h3>On order mattering in HTML</h3>
    </summary>
    
    <p>Documents have always been a powerful medium.  But it was inevitable that
    we would strain against their linearity.  In the dynamic medium, we want to
    keep what is powerful about documents while freeing them from their
    dimensional constraints.</p>

      <h4>On order mattering in composition</h4>
      
      <p>A document is a <em>composition</em>, that is, a “putting together” of
      parts.  Composition is powerful.  An effective composition is said to be
      “greater than the sum of its parts.”  This suggests that there is
      something in way the parts are composed that itself contributes to the
      effect.  In some cases that “extra” thing is the order in which they
      occur.  Think of the AABA form commonly used in music and rhetoric.</p>

      <h4>When does order matter in HTML?</h4>
      
      <p><em>Coordinated</em> composition is impossible in an environment like
      the web.  HTML documents are and will continue to be the locus of
      components from multiple parties.  These parties have no say in the order
      in which their artifacts will appear in the document.</p>

        <h5>How order matters in scripts</h5>
        
        <p>Order matters in scripts because of the <em>execution model</em> of
        scripts in HTML documents.  In particular, scripts are executed in the
        order in which they are encountered.  Because scripts may have side
        effects, the order in which they are evaluated can matter <em>at that
        time</em>.</p>
        
        <p>This creates a difficulty for composition, particularly the kind of
        composition that occurs in an open environment such as the web.</p>
        
        <p>Formal module definitions are a way to mitigate this.</p>

        <h5>How order matters in style rules</h5>
        
        <p>Like most rule-based languages, CSS is <em>declarative</em>, meaning
        that it is based on statements rather than instructions.  As in other
        rule languages, rules in CSS are mostly independent of order.  Yet (as
        is also the case in some other rule languages), there <em>is</em> a
        lexical order defined, and it is used as an arbiter between rules when
        other factors cannot choose from among multiple matches.</p>
