      <h3>Free element visibility</h3>
    </summary>

    <p>
      Things are not real until we can see them. So the first order of business
      is to
      <a href="#make-invisible-elements-visible"
        >make invisible elements visible</a
      >. (See also the appendix
      <a href="#markup-versus-programming"
        >“Markup languages <i>versus</i> programming languages”</a
      >)
    </p>

    <p>
      The two most powerful elements in HTML—<code>script</code> and
      <code>style</code>—are both invisible by default.
    </p>

    <p>We start by using a style rule to make style rules visible:</p>

    <style contenteditable="true">
      style {
        display: initial;
      }
    </style>

    <p>
      This rule is critical. Without this rule (or some equivalent), you'd be
      unable to see the rule itself, or any of the other rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      A more practical version follows, which makes scripts visible as well:
    </p>

    <style contenteditable="true">
      style,
      script {
        display: block; /* `initial` also works, but gives odd results */
        white-space: pre; /* Preserve whitespace (it's collapsed in normal content) */
      }
    </style>

    <p>This also goes for the document head and its contents.</p>

    <style contenteditable="true">
      head,
      link,
      title,
      meta {
        display: block;
        white-space: pre;
        font-family: monospace;
      }
    </style>

    <p>
      In practice, you won't see <code>link</code> or <code>meta</code> elements
      because they have no content (only attributes).
