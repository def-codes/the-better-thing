  <h2>Enumerated sets</h2>
  <p>A set is a kind of collection</p>
  <p>
    RDF includes a notion of containers but not of sets specifically. However,
    RDF resources are in some ways sets by default, in that graphs are sets of
    triples, and not multisets.

    See As Shelley Powers notes in

  <blockquote>
    use the RDF collection as sparingly as you would use the RDF Container—use
    only when no other construct matches your specific needs, and use it
    specifically as the specification intended it to be used. If you’re unsure
    about the intent, then don’t use it.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Dropping into this collection might cause an
    <code>rdf:member</code> assertion to be made about the item being dropped.
    This could be implied by an RDFa <code>rel</code> attribute on the
    container.

  <p>Duplicate items should not be accepted (but currently are).</p>
  <p>In mathematics, sets are usually denoted with curly braces {}</p>
  <p>
    HTML doesn't have any notion about sets as such. The closest thing is the
    unordered list, which can be used to represent an enumerated set. However,
    it doesn't have a notion of uniqueness.
