      <h3>The despecialization of special elements</h3>
    </summary>
    
    <p>In the old days, elements like <code>head</code>, <code>style</code>, and
    <code>script</code> were specially excluded from rendering.  At some point,
    for consistency's sake, browsers started treating these “special” elements
    just like anything else for display purposes.  Now, these invisible elements
    are simply hidden with default rules that set their <code>display</code>
    property to <code>none</code>, which is easily overridden.  (Citation
    needed.  But I'm willing to bet this is the case.)</p>
    
    <p>Some people <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/18182211">discovered
    these capabilities by accident</a> by using <code>display</code> rules with
    an unintentionally-excessive scope.  As recently as 2018, the ability to
    show <em>and edit</em> these elements even <a
    href="https://css-tricks.com/did-you-know-that-style-and-script-tags-can-be-set-to-display-block/">took
    some self-styled CSS authorities by surprise</a>, though as to “why we would
    want to do this,” the author was “not entirely sure.”  </p>
