      <h3>making stylesheets persist with document</h3>
    </summary>

    <p>
      We can inline stylesheets that are loaded from external sources—as long as
      we're in an environment with sufficient permissions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that relative URL's can be used from stylesheets, and they are
      interpreted as relative to the stylesheet (not the document that loaded
      it). This technique doesn't deal with such URL's, which are liable to be
      incorrect after inlining.

      <h4>Restrictions when using local file protocol</h4>

      <p>
        When attempting to read the content of externally-loaded
        stylesheets—including those with a <code>file:</code> origin on the same
        local machine—you get a message like
      </p>

      <output>
        <pre>
          Not allowed to access cross-origin stylesheet
        </pre>
      </output>

        was resolved as “WONTFIX” with the comment:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        We treat `file:` origins as unique, which denies them access to a number
        of features. `cssRules` is one of them, as reading CSS data cross-origin
        has been a source of data leakage in the past. I understand that it's a
        bit annoying for development locally, but cutting a hole in the security
        checks for this special case is likely to cause future security issues
        that I'd prefer to avoid.

      <blockquote>
        As of Chrome 64 you'll need to use a local development server to test
        functionality that depends on the CSS Object Model.

      <p>This is also the case in Firefox now.</p>
