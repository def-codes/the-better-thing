  <h2>cooking and modeling processes</h2>
  <p>
    Following is a set of concepts needed for modeling processes with analogies
    to cooking. This is a rough, informal sketch of ideas to be fleshed out more
    formally.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>resources / ingredients</li>
    <li>timers / waiting</li>
    <li>verbs / operations from known vocabulary: chop / mix etc</li>
    <li>perishable / expiring resources</li>
    <li>
      constraints: don't leave empty pan on fire for more than N seconds
    </li>
    <li>
      alternate context for terms within scope of recipe: substitute vegan
      versions of all animal-based ingredients
    </li>
    <li>
      running out of something, temporarily, requesting / waiting for
      replenishment / service
    </li>
    <li>
      oven simulation using force layout (opening door bumps it towards room
      temp, which could itself be a continuous variable simulation)
    </li>
    <li>event: when oven reaches 350Â°, put prepared pan into oven</li>
    <li>
      referencing things / naming composites. "the prepared pan", "the stuffing"
    </li>
    <li>
      attribute queries: "the wet ingredients" and "the dry ingredients"
    </li>
    <li>irreversible transforms: aggregates, e.g. mixing liquids</li>
    <li>output of one process is input to another</li>
    <li>
      state machine: when a pancake begins to bubble, flip it. then when it no
      longer sticks to the pan, remove it from pan (dequeue)
    </li>
    <li>
      event from stream with threshold condition: when the onions are browned,
      add the broccoli
    </li>
    <li>
      error handling: if you burn what's in the pan, throw it out and restart
      that part of the process over
    </li>
    <li>
      precondition: ensure knives are sharpened
    </li>
    <li>
      inference rule: range/domain. chopping is only for solids, pouring is only
      for liquids
    </li>
    <li>event from external system: rice cooker switches to "finished"</li>
    <li>
      synchronization: (when the crust and the filling are complete), put the
      filling into the crust
    </li>
    <li>
      parallelization: while the oven is preheating / while the dough is rising
    </li>
    <li>
      parallel with constraints: use one of N burners
    </li>
    <li>
      transforms with possible reverse mapping: map, filter (cookie dough ball
      <-> cookie)
    </li>
    <li>
      instance of another model: serve with the bread from recipe X
    </li>
    <li>
      Use output of another process as input to this process: with the frosting
      from recipe X, frost the finished cake
    </li>
    <li>
      multiple instances of another model: make two of the flaky pie crusts
    </li>
    <li>
      arbitrary selection: make a pie crust of your choice (or 2)
    </li>
    <li>parameterization: multiply recipe, use variant (whole-wheat)</li>
    <li>rules: 2 cups water to one cup white rice</li>
    <li>rule specializations: 2.5 cups water for brown rice</li>
    <li>override: substitute ingredients</li>
    <li>
      blocking queues: fixed-capacity cookware (e.g boil 6 eggs at a time,
      dequeue when it floats)
    </li>
    <li>
      environmental factors: humidity, air pressure and temperature.
    </li>
    <li>batching</li>
    <li>loops: repeat (sub) process for each stuffed pepper</li>
    <li>
      environmental factors: choose a seasonal/regional vegetable
    </li>
    <li>
      state: make a cookie with one spoonful of batter until you run out.
      generally, things in any state of preparation. state of stove range, N
      burners
    </li>
    <li>
      dataflow: room / oven temperature. "cookedness" of something as a
      continuous (discretized) variable. water flow filling container. ratio of
      size of dough rising (e.g. when the dough has doubled in size)
    </li>
    <li>
      external events: timer, arrival of delivery (e.g. for ingredients)
    </li>
    <li>
      reflected (not reified) processes. e.g. consumers taking from queue (i.e.
      people walking into the kitchen and taking from stack as you cook).
      simulation, can you reach a threshold amount with different rates of
      production / consumption
    </li>
    <li>units (tbsp, tsp, cup, quart)</li>
  </ul>
