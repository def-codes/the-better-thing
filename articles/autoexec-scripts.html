  <h3>the bootstrapper</h3>

  <p><b>Update April 2020</b>: This concerns a crude way of adding startup
  scripts to a document and should be superseded by modules or models.</p>

  <p>Everything that we don't get for free, we have to accomplish with script.
  Therefore, the first thing we need is a way to use scripts (without leaving
  the document).</p>
  
  <p>We will need to write, run, and save scripts.  We'll take up each one
  separately.</p>
  
  <p>Find all designated script tags.  The timeout is to wait until the script
  has loaded (to cover elements that are not in the document yet at this
  point).</p>
  
  <script>
    window.setTimeout(() => {
    for (const script of document.querySelectorAll('[data-autoexec="true"]'))
    eval(script.innerText || script.value);
    }, 1);
  </script>
  
  <textarea data-autoexec="true">
    console.log("hey Trem√©!!!!")
  </textarea>
  
  <p>All right, now we should be able to create scripts and edit them
  dynamically just by adding the <code>data-autoexec</code> attribute to a
  <code>textarea</code>.</p>
  
  <textarea data-autoexec="true">
    console.log("gee isn't there anything I can do besides console log?? :(");
  </textarea>
