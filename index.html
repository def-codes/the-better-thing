            <p>MELD is a project for creating a dynamic medium on top of HTML
            documents.  A MELD document is anything you can think of: an
            interactive presentation, a model of the Earth, a personal computing
            environment.  MELD supports the arbitrary organization of “programs”
            into documents and is itself is embodied in HTML fragments, meaning
            that you could tuck it away in an appendix or scatter its parts as
            you see fit.  However, because of the way that HTML works, some of
            that foundation must physically (i.e. lexically) precede everything
            else in order for the system to work.  That's what this preamble is
            for: to provide a minimal basis for everything else.</p>
            
            <p>(This still does not precede the document <code>head</code>.
            MELD systems avoid using the document head because it's
            invisible.)</p>

              <h3>AMD loader</h3>
            </summary>
            
            <p>The first order of business is to define an asynchronous module
            loader.  This allows later pieces to be defined and used in any order.
            This module loader is mostly conformant to the <a
            href="https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md">Asynchronous
            Module Definition (AMD) spec</a>, with the following exceptions:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><code>define</code> is lazy: it doesn't execute the factory
              function.  <code>require</code> is eager.</li>
            </ul>

                  <h4>basic</h4>
                </summary>
                
                <p>We start with a basic module loader.  Following is a (far
                from final) implementation of a minimal subset of AMD.  It
                handles asynchronous definitions, but has no notion of remote
                scripts.</p>
                
                <p>One distinguishing feature of this implementation is that it
                posts a global event whenever a module is defined.  This
                information can be put to various uses by listeners, such as to
                construct a dependency graph.</p>

                <p>We now extend the basic AMD core defined above to include
                support for name resolution and remote script retrieval.</p>

            <p>The AMD loader provides functions that can be used to create the

            the only reason I do it separately is that I don't currently have a
            way to configure the loader (paths, etc) after the fact.</p>

        <h2>Illustration that AMD module persistence works</h2>
        
        <p>One of the chief hurdles of persistence is capturing transitive
        dependencies.  If we require an external module that in turn requires an
        external module, we need to incorporate <em>both</em> into a standalone
        document in order for it to work.</p>
        
        <p>The following <a href="#something-moving-fig">figure</a> shows an
        animation that is the result of an AMD module which depends on another
        AMD module.</p>

          <p>This project will create an HTML document that offers the following
          capabilities:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>the document does the expected thing for common actions</li>
            <li>the foundation is sufficient to build more powerful tools</li>
            <li>the mechanisms used support persistence and portability</li>
            <li>support a modular form of composition using external
            resources</li>
            <li>support the breaking up of script execution units into physical
            pieces</li>
            <li>whatever code is needed to get this up and running can be
            “tucked away” into a section (like an appendix) of this document
            that is normally hidden.</li>

          <p>In this section, we look at (yes, <em>look at</em>) the web
          platform's <em>built-in</em> capabilities supporting dynamic
          documents.  While they are not sufficient for all of our needs, we can
          use these features with minimal effort and build on them.</p>
          
          <p>By “free” I mean “without script.”  If we have to implement it
          ourselves, it's not free.</p>

                <h3>Free element visibility</h3>
              </summary>
              
              <p>Things are not real until we can see them.  So the first order
              of business is to <a href="#make-invisible-elements-visible">make
              invisible elements visible</a>. (See also the appendix <a
              href="#markup-versus-programming">“Markup languages <i>versus</i>
              programming languages”</a>) </p>

              <p>The two most powerful elements in HTML—<code>script</code> and
              <code>style</code>—are both invisible by default.</p>
              
              <p>We start by using a style rule to make style rules visible:</p>
              
              <style contenteditable="true">style { display: initial }</style>
              
              <p>This rule is critical.  Without this rule (or some equivalent),
              you'd be unable to see the rule itself, or any of the other
              rules.</p>
              
              <p>A more practical version follows, which makes scripts visible
              as well:</p>
              
              <style contenteditable="true">
style,
script
{
  display: block;  /* `initial` also works, but gives odd results */
  white-space: pre; /* Preserve whitespace (it's collapsed in normal content) */
}
              </style>
              
              <p>This also goes for the document head and its contents.</p>
              
              <style contenteditable="true">
head, link, title, meta
{
  display: block;
  white-space: pre;
  font-family: monospace;
}
              </style>
              
              <p>In practice, you won't see <code>link</code> or
              <code>meta</code> elements because they have no content (only
              attributes).</p>

              <summary>
                <h3>Free content editability</h3>
              </summary>
              
              <p>The web platform includes a built-in way to make elements
              editable.  The global <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable"><code>contenteditable</code></a>
              attribute (which controls the boolean <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/contentEditable"><code>contentEditable</code></a>
              interface property) indicates that “the user” (that's you) should
              be able to type in the area.</p>
              
              <p>Making a <code>style</code> block <code>contenteditable</code>
              will immediately reflect changes that you make.  (Tested in
              Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.)</p>
              
              <p>Go ahead, try it.</p>
              
              <style contenteditable="true">
body {
  color: black; /* edit this to set the document's default text color */
}
              </style>
              
              <p>You can also make <code>script</code> tags editable.  However,
              they are <em>not</em> re-evaluated when edited.</p>
              
              <script contenteditable="true">
console.log("mind blown");
              </script>

              <p>Most elements, including <code>style</code>, will inherit the
              <code>contentEditable</code> property, all the way up to the
              <code>html</code> (document).  Some elements (to wit,
              <code>title</code>) do not inherit this property, but are only
              editable when they are explicitly marked as such.</p>

                    <h4>Indicating when elements are editable</h4>
                  </summary>
                  
                  <p>How can you tell when something is editable, other than
                  trying it?</p>
                  
                  <p>If the browser lets you put your cursor into a regular text
                  element (i.e. a place that is not a text input), then it's
                  editable.</p>
                  
                  <p>It would be useful if we could provide additional visual
                  cues that something can be edited.  Here is a rule that
                  targets elements with the <code>contenteditable</code>
                  property set.</p>
                  
                  <style contenteditable="true">
[contenteditable=""],
[contenteditable="true"]
{
  background-color: #FFC;
}
                  </style>

                  <p>(Note that “enumerated” attributes are enabled when the
                  value is <code>true</code> or the empty string.)</p>

                  <p>Because <code>contenteditable</code> is inherited (in most
                  cases), we cannot reliably indicate editability on individual
                  elements using CSS.  CSS can only target <em>explicit
                  attribute values</em>, not <em>effective property values</em>.
                  However, we can use a CSS property that is itself inherited
                  (such as <code>background-color</code>).</p>
                  
                  <p>Editability can also be turned <em>off</em>.  To prevent
                  non-editable elements from inheriting the indicator, we can
                  reset them to their initial value.</p>

                  <style contenteditable="true">
[contenteditable=""] [contenteditable="false"],
[contenteditable="true"] [contenteditable="false"]
{
  background-color: white;
}
                  </style>
                  
                  <p>It's not sufficient to set the color to
                  <code>initial</code>, as this is transparent and the parent's
                  background color will still show through.</p>
                  
                  <figure>
                    <p contenteditable="true">
                      You can change me.  And you can change me.  <em

                      type.  In fact, while you cannot make edits to that text
                      <em>per se</em>, you can select across the editable
                      regions and delete it.  I don't know whether this is

                <h3>defensiveness</h3>
              </summary>
              
              <p>The objective of portability is that (to the extent possible) a
              document can travel from one environment to another and retain its
              essential character (for lack of a better word).</p>
              
              <p>Some of that preservation relies on those capabilities that
              will become unavailable in standalone mode.  Therefore, a portable
              document must <em>pre-emptively</em> take the steps that will
              allow it to survive in the wild.</p>
              
              <p>What this means in practice is that we need to inline scripts
              (and other things that come from the host) as soon as the document
              is loaded.</p>

              <p>This script finds and inlines all of the remote scripts in the
              document by fetching their content.  Since it fetches an arbitrary
              resource from an arbitrary location, it will only work in hosted
              mode.  (At least, I have not found a way to access the content of
              a remote script that was fetched via a script <code>src</code>.)
              </p>
              
              <script src="./bootstrap-temp/inline-scripts.js"></script>
              
              <p>That code replaces remote script references with inline
              scripts.  It also annotates the inlined script with the source
              URL, so that we know where it came from.  We make that annotation
              visible with style rules:</p>
              
              <style contenteditable="true">
script[data-source]::after
{
  content: 'from ' attr(data-source);
  display: block;
  font-style: italic;
}
              </style>

              <summary>
                <h3>saving ourselves</h3>
              </summary>
              
              <p>Portability depends on our having the ability to save the
              document.</p>
              
              <aside>Does this come before or after the AMD loader?</aside>
              
              <p>This module provides tools for persisting the state of the
              document and making its content available for download using
              ordinary links.</p>
              
              <script src="./bootstrap-temp/document-persistence.js"></script>
              
              <p>That defines the mechanism for making a download link, but
              doesn't actually apply it to the document.</p>
              
              <script>
require(["@def-codes/meld/document-persistence"], functions => {
  functions.wire_save_links();
})
              </script>
              
              <p>A few notes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>This doesn't guarantee that the document has a download
                link.  We could also create one if one is not found.  The only
                question would be, where to put it?</li>
                <li>Simply taking the document content as-is will not give the
                desired or expected result for many particular cases (such as
                preserving the content of textareas).  To support these cases,
                we will need a way to register functions to perform synchronous
                preprocessing of the document before document
                serialization.</li>

              <h3>House rules</h3>
            </summary>
            
            <p>The following style rules are included just to make the document
            more readable.  They are not essential to the functionality being
            discussed.  This does, however, illustrate a usage of dynamic
            documents.</p>
            
            <style contenteditable="true">
              body {
              font-family: sans-serif; /* Sans Serif fonts tend to be more screen friendly */
              font-size: 16pt; /* I like big fonts and I cannot lie */
              }
            </style>
            
            <p>Following are common rules to make narrative document content
            more readable than browser defaults.</p>
            
            <style contenteditable="true">
              main {
              width: 50rem;  /* A comfortable reading width */
              max-width: 100%; /* Don't overflow if the viewport is less than width */
              margin-left: auto;  /* This and the following rule center the block horizontally. */
              margin-right: auto;
              }
            </style>
            
            <p>The <code>aside</code> element, although it has to be placed at
            some definite point in the document, is not part of the document
            “flow.”</p>
            
            <style contenteditable="true">
              aside {
              float: right;
              clear: both;
              width: 50%;
              margin-left: 2rem;
              margin-bottom: 2rem;
              }
            </style>
            
            <p>Blockquotes traditionally have certain formatting.  Some of that,
            such as the left margin, is a default style in most browsers.</p>
            
            <style contenteditable="true">
              blockquote {
              font-size: smaller; /* block quotes conventionally use smaller font */
              }
            </style>

            <p>I'm a fan of the <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details">“disclosure”</a>
            elements.  They provide a free way to hide and show things.</p>
            
            <p>The <code>summary</code> element is affordable (you can act on
            it), but the default styles do not indicate this.</p>
            
            <style contenteditable="true">
              summary:hover
              {
              cursor: pointer;
              background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
              }
            </style>
            
            <p>I'm using disclosure elements to make sections collapsible.  For
            some reason (I guess related to built-in rules), block-level
            elements do not appear when used inside of a <code>summary</code>.
            This fixes that.</p>
            
            <style contenteditable="true">
summary > h2,
summary > h3,
summary > h4
{
  display: inline;
}
            </style>
            
            <p>By default, text inputs are far too small.  If I wanted something
            that small, I'd use an <code>input</code>.  A textarea should be
            like a block-level element, which automatically uses the available
            horizontal space.</p>

            <style contenteditable="true">
textarea { width: 100%; }
            </style>
            
            <p>In general, we would prefer that scripts be editable, in which
            case they would use a <code>textarea</code>.  However, we do still
            see some <code>script</code> elements, which are read-only.  Scripts
            need to be <em>interpreted</em> differently than their surrounding
            content, and thus should be demarked in some way, to cue the change
            in context.</p>
            <p>But <em>how</em> should scripts be demarked?  Many factors bear
            on this.  I will not go into all of them now, but in general, I
            believe that physical demarcations should be reserved to indicate
            physical distinctions.  While I personally prefer proportional fonts
            for code, I would note that the <em>JavaScript</em> code in question
            here is not what we ultimately want to be reading anyway.  A
            typewriter font suggests a suitably archaic computing idiom.</p>

            <style contenteditable="true">
script {
  font-family: Consolas, monospace;
}
            </style>
            
            <p>“Consolas” is a monospace font that is available on many Windows
            systems and is better than the default of “Courier New.”</p>

        <section>
          <p>We need a place to put modules.  When something is imported
          transitively, it needs to be captured and put there.</p>
          
          <script src="./bootstrap-temp/amd-module-persistence.js"></script>
          
          <p>There's a problem with this.  It doesn't work for scripts that are
          loaded by path.  That is, once you leave the hosting context, you can
          no longer access things at relative paths.  Examples.</p>
          
          <p>Let's say that I load a script at <code>/hijack-console.js</code>.
          The inlining routing will inline it with an annotation that it came
          from that path.</p>
          
          <p>Because the script is embedded in the saved document, it doesn't
          matter where it originally came from, right?</p>
          
          <p>Right.  This would only matter if something else were trying to
          reference it.  For “standalone” scripts, this is not a problem because
          the only reference has been substituted with the inlined version.</p>
          
          <p>However, it <em>is</em> a problem for modules that are loaded as
          AMD dependencies.  Why?</p>
          
          <p>When something requires <code>/hijack-console.js</code> by naming
          it explicitly as a dependency, the loader will treat it as a
          “top-level” id.</p>
