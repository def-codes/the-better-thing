					<h2>what's an article?</h2>
					<p>At the risk of a circular definition, an article is any fabriated
					thing.  The (HTML5) spec defines the `article` tag as being suitable
					for basically “anything that could be syndicated.”  (Here's the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/sections.html#the-article-element">actual
					definition</a>.) Etymonline has “<a
					href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/syndicate#etymonline_v_22533">syndicate</a>”
					as, To judge together.</p>

					<h2>darkening or lightening</h2>
					<p>Things may contribute light or consume light.</p>
					<p>We cannot talk about a “lack of light.”</p>
					<p>The extremes map directly to black and white.</p>
					<p>You may blend in by using a low value (0.1 or 0.2) for alpha.</p>
					<p>Low luminosity, especially with high alpha, consumes light.</p>
					<p>Low alpha values compose better than high alpha values.</p>
					<p>Order matters less when several colors can be seen, though the
					composition may become muddy.</p>

				</article> <section> <heading> <h2>DOM elements are real</h2> <h3>How
				can headings be useful to you?  Shall we use it for preamble?</h3>
				</heading> <p>About DOM elements one thing is sure: they are real.  They
				are as real as anything in the world of computing, in that people's time
				is devoted to them.  Moreover, most people are, right now, in possession
				of ready tools for their discovery and inspection!  Not to mention
				intervention!  I'm talking about the developer tools of course, which
				have been built-in to common browsers for years.  I mean, that's two
				levels deep.  How did we get here, and how do we get more of that sweet,
				sweet meta-action?</p> <p></p> <p>So, while all elements are portable,
				consider the `article` element as a special agent of portability.
				Article indicates a disposition, an embedded intent to be shared, to be
				picked up and moved around.  Indeed, what other kind of thing is there?
				Yet most elements we would not expect to survive out of context.
				Article represents a (more or less) standalone thing, that you may carry
				anywhere and leave anywhere.</p> <p>Some things are labeled</p>
				<details> <summary>This is a summary</summary> <p>Some things have
				details.  You can use the `details` and `summary` elements together to
				easily hide extended content.</p> <p>Note that details/summary are
				stateful.</p> </details> <p>Traits have indicators, so do elements.
				(indicate :syndicate).  Declarative rules style them.  Never forget
				that.  Many professionals learn and use CSS without need for imperative
				languages.</p> <p>The ideal is a combinatorial, or compositional system,
				where semantics from multiple domains can be overlaid on an otherwise
				immutable thing without conflict or (too much) loss.  (Indeed, what is
				the fundamental quantity in this industry that is not preserved?  I.e. a
				little of which is lost each time?  Yes, time.)</p> </section>
