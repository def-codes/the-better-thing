      <h2>cooking and modeling processes</h2>
      <p>
        Following is a set of concepts needed for modeling processes with
        analogies to cooking. This is a rough, informal sketch of ideas to be
        fleshed out more formally.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>resources / ingredients</li>
        <li>timers / waiting</li>
        <li>verbs / operations from known vocabulary: chop / mix etc</li>
        <li>perishable / expiring resources</li>
        <li>
          constraints: don't leave empty pan on fire for more than N seconds
        </li>
        <li>
          alternate context for terms within scope of recipe: substitute vegan
          versions of all animal-based ingredients
        </li>
        <li>
          running out of something, temporarily, requesting / waiting for
          replenishment / service
        </li>
        <li>
          oven simulation using force layout (opening door bumps it towards room
          temp, which could itself be a continuous variable simulation)
        </li>
        <li>event: when oven reaches 350°, put prepared pan into oven</li>
        <li>
          referencing things / naming composites. "the prepared pan", "the
          stuffing"
        </li>
        <li>
          attribute queries: "the wet ingredients" and "the dry ingredients"
        </li>
        <li>irreversible transforms: aggregates, e.g. mixing liquids</li>
        <li>output of one process is input to another</li>
        <li>
          state machine: when a pancake begins to bubble, flip it. then when it
          no longer sticks to the pan, remove it from pan (dequeue)
        </li>
        <li>
          event from stream with threshold condition: when the onions are
          browned, add the broccoli
        </li>
        <li>
          error handling: if you burn what's in the pan, throw it out and
          restart that part of the process over
        </li>
        <li>
          precondition: ensure knives are sharpened
        </li>
        <li>
          inference rule: range/domain. chopping is only for solids, pouring is
          only for liquids
        </li>
        <li>event from external system: rice cooker switches to "finished"</li>
        <li>
          synchronization: (when the crust and the filling are complete), put
          the filling into the crust
        </li>
        <li>
          parallelization: while the oven is preheating / while the dough is
          rising
        </li>
        <li>
          parallel with constraints: use one of N burners
        </li>
        <li>
          transforms with possible reverse mapping: map, filter (cookie dough
          ball <-> cookie)
        </li>
        <li>
          instance of another model: serve with the bread from recipe X
        </li>
        <li>
          Use output of another process as input to this process: with the
          frosting from recipe X, frost the finished cake
        </li>
        <li>
          multiple instances of another model: make two of the flaky pie crusts
        </li>
        <li>
          arbitrary selection: make a pie crust of your choice (or 2)
        </li>
        <li>parameterization: multiply recipe, use variant (whole-wheat)</li>
        <li>rules: 2 cups water to one cup white rice</li>

      <p>drag something over “apply” to invoke.</p>
      <p>
        Idea is that this asserts an invocation somewhere. When the graph has an
        invocation “driver” (interpreter), this will invoke the function and
        assert a result. Then a display which is an interpretation of the graph
        that includes the invocation, will show the result. What graph will that
        be?

      <h2>Enumerated sets</h2>
      <p>A set is a kind of collection</p>
      <p>
        RDF includes a notion of containers but not of sets specifically.
        However, RDF resources are in some ways sets by default, in that graphs
        are sets of triples, and not multisets.
      </p>
      <p>
        See As Shelley Powers notes in
        <a
          href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-rdf/0596002637/ch04.html"
          >Chapter 4 from <i>Practical RDF</i>,
        </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        use the RDF collection as sparingly as you would use the RDF
        Container—use only when no other construct matches your specific needs,
        and use it specifically as the specification intended it to be used. If
        you’re unsure about the intent, then don’t use it.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Dropping into this collection might cause an
        <code>rdf:member</code> assertion to be made about the item being
        dropped. This could be implied by an RDFa <code>rel</code> attribute on
        the container.
      </p>
      <p>Duplicate items should not be accepted (but currently are).</p>
      <p>In mathematics, sets are usually denoted with curly braces {}</p>
      <p>
        HTML doesn't have any notion about sets as such. The closest thing is
        the unordered list, which can be used to represent an enumerated set.
        However, it doesn't have a notion of uniqueness.

            <p>
              MELD is a project for creating a dynamic medium on top of HTML
              documents. A MELD document is anything you can think of: an
              interactive presentation, a model of the Earth, a personal
              computing environment. MELD supports the arbitrary organization of
              “programs” into documents and is itself is embodied in HTML
              fragments, meaning that you could tuck it away in an appendix or
              scatter its parts as you see fit. However, because of the way that
              HTML works, some of that foundation must physically (i.e.
              lexically) precede everything else in order for the system to
              work. That's what this preamble is for: to provide a minimal basis
              for everything else.
            </p>

            <p>
              (This still does not precede the document <code>head</code>. MELD
              systems avoid using the document head because it's invisible.)

              <h3>AMD loader</h3>

            <p>
              The first order of business is to define an asynchronous module
              loader. This allows later pieces to be defined and used in any
              order. This module loader is mostly conformant to the
              <a href="https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md"
                >Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) spec</a
              >, with the following exceptions:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>define</code> is lazy: it doesn't execute the factory
                function. <code>require</code> is eager.
              </li>
            </ul>

                  <h4>basic</h4>
                </summary>

                <p>
                  We start with a basic module loader. Following is a (far from
                  final) implementation of a minimal subset of AMD. It handles
                  asynchronous definitions, but has no notion of remote scripts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One distinguishing feature of this implementation is that it
                  posts a global event whenever a module is defined. This
                  information can be put to various uses by listeners, such as
                  to construct a dependency graph.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We now extend the basic AMD core defined above to include
                  support for name resolution and remote script retrieval.

            <p>
              The AMD loader provides functions that can be used to create the
              globals, but it doesn't actually create them. It should. I think
              the only reason I do it separately is that I don't currently have
              a way to configure the loader (paths, etc) after the fact.

        <h2>Illustration that AMD module persistence works</h2>

        <p>
          One of the chief hurdles of persistence is capturing transitive
          dependencies. If we require an external module that in turn requires
          an external module, we need to incorporate <em>both</em> into a
          standalone document in order for it to work.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following <a href="#something-moving-fig">figure</a> shows an
          animation that is the result of an AMD module which depends on another
          AMD module.
        </p>

        <figure id="something-moving-fig">
          <output id="something-moving-output"></output>
          <figcaption>
            Here is a thing that shows a transitive dependency must have loaded.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The following script triggers the initialization</p>

        <script>
          require(["./bootstrap-temp/something-moving.js"], thing => {
            thing.make_something_moving_in("something-moving-output");
          });
        </script>
      </section>

      <p>
        <b>Status:</b> you can use the above link to save the document with
        dynamic changes to HTML (such as edits to the title), and the resulting
        (standalone) document can also be saved in a way that persists such
        changes!

          <p>
            In this section, we look at (yes, <em>look at</em>) the web
            platform's <em>built-in</em> capabilities supporting dynamic
            documents. While they are not sufficient for all of our needs, we
            can use these features with minimal effort and build on them.
          </p>

          <p>
            By “free” I mean “without script.” If we have to implement it
            ourselves, it's not free.

              </summary>

              <p>
                The objective of portability is that (to the extent possible) a
                document can travel from one environment to another and retain
                its essential character (for lack of a better word).
              </p>

              <p>
                Some of that preservation relies on those capabilities that will
                become unavailable in standalone mode. Therefore, a portable
                document must <em>pre-emptively</em> take the steps that will
                allow it to survive in the wild.
              </p>

              <p>
                What this means in practice is that we need to inline scripts
                (and other things that come from the host) as soon as the
                document is loaded.
              </p>

              <p>
                This script finds and inlines all of the remote scripts in the
                document by fetching their content. Since it fetches an
                arbitrary resource from an arbitrary location, it will only work
                in hosted mode. (At least, I have not found a way to access the
                content of a remote script that was fetched via a script
                <code>src</code>.)
              </p>

              <script src="./bootstrap-temp/inline-scripts.js"></script>

              <p>
                That code replaces remote script references with inline scripts.
                It also annotates the inlined script with the source URL, so
                that we know where it came from. We make that annotation visible
                with style rules:
              </p>

              <style contenteditable="true">
                script[data-source]::after {
                  content: "from " attr(data-source);
                  display: block;
                  font-style: italic;
                }

                Portability depends on our having the ability to save the

              <p>
                This module provides tools for persisting the state of the
                document and making its content available for download using
                ordinary links.
              </p>

              <script src="./bootstrap-temp/document-persistence.js"></script>

              <p>
                That defines the mechanism for making a download link, but
                doesn't actually apply it to the document.
              </p>

              <script>
                require(["@def-codes/meld/document-persistence"], functions => {
                  functions.wire_save_links();
                });
              </script>

              <p>A few notes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This doesn't guarantee that the document has a download link.
                  We could also create one if one is not found. The only
                  question would be, where to put it?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Simply taking the document content as-is will not give the
                  desired or expected result for many particular cases (such as
                  preserving the content of textareas). To support these cases,
                  we will need a way to register functions to perform
                  synchronous preprocessing of the document before document
                  serialization.
                </li>

              The following style rules are included just to make the document
              more readable. They are not essential to the functionality being
              discussed. This does, however, illustrate a usage of dynamic
              documents.
            </p>

            <style contenteditable="true">
              body {
                font-family: sans-serif; /* Sans Serif fonts tend to be more screen friendly */
                font-size: 16pt; /* I like big fonts and I cannot lie */
              }
            </style>

            <p>
              Following are common rules to make narrative document content more
              readable than browser defaults.
            </p>

            <style contenteditable="true">
              main {
                width: 50rem; /* A comfortable reading width */
                max-width: 100%; /* Don't overflow if the viewport is less than width */
                margin-left: auto; /* This and the following rule center the block horizontally. */
                margin-right: auto;
              }
            </style>

            <p>
              The <code>aside</code> element, although it has to be placed at
              some definite point in the document, is not part of the document
              “flow.”
            </p>

            <style contenteditable="true">
              aside {
                float: right;
                clear: both;
                width: 50%;
                margin-left: 2rem;
                margin-bottom: 2rem;
              }
            </style>

            <p>
              Blockquotes traditionally have certain formatting. Some of that,
              such as the left margin, is a default style in most browsers.
            </p>

            <style contenteditable="true">
              blockquote {
                font-size: smaller; /* block quotes conventionally use smaller font */
              }
            </style>

            <p>
              I'm a fan of the
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details"
                >“disclosure”</a
              >
              elements. They provide a free way to hide and show things.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>summary</code> element is affordable (you can act on
              it), but the default styles do not indicate this.
            </p>

            <pre contenteditable="true">
              summary:hover {
                cursor: pointer;
                background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
              }
            </pre>
            <aside>This is now covered by the element stylesheet.</aside>

            <p>
              I'm using disclosure elements to make sections collapsible. For
              some reason (I guess related to built-in rules), block-level
              elements do not appear when used inside of a <code>summary</code>.
              This fixes that.
            </p>

            <pre contenteditable="true">
              summary > h2,
              summary > h3,
              summary > h4 {
                display: inline;
              }
            </pre>
            <aside>
              But this has unwanted effects when used with element visibility
              rules, which prevent the problem noted above.
            </aside>

            <p>
              By default, text inputs are far too small. If I wanted something
              that small, I'd use an <code>input</code>. A textarea should be
              like a block-level element, which automatically uses the available
              horizontal space.
            </p>

            <style contenteditable="true">
              textarea {
                width: 100%;
              }
            </style>

            <p>
              In general, we would prefer that scripts be editable, in which
              case they would use a <code>textarea</code>. However, we do still
              see some <code>script</code> elements, which are read-only.
              Scripts need to be <em>interpreted</em> differently than their
              surrounding content, and thus should be demarked in some way, to
              cue the change in context.
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>how</em> should scripts be demarked? Many factors bear on
              this. I will not go into all of them now, but in general, I
              believe that physical demarcations should be reserved to indicate
              physical distinctions. While I personally prefer proportional
              fonts for code, I would note that the <em>JavaScript</em> code in
              question here is not what we ultimately want to be reading anyway.
              A typewriter font suggests a suitably archaic computing idiom.

              “Consolas” is a monospace font that is available on many Windows
