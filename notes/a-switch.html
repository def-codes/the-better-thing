          <h3>a switch</h3>
          <p>Clearly, we should be able to talk about a switch.</p>
          <p>A switch is a thing that</p>
          <ul>
            <li>can be in one of two states and</li>
            <li>that responds to messages asking that its state be changed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What do I mean by “talk about?”</p>
          <p>I should be able to assert that something is a switch, or has a
          switch (has something that is a switch).</p>
          <p>We should be able to say that a switch is “connected to” something,
          where that something is a cell.  Where a cell is something that can
          reflect different states at different times.</p>
          <p>But we're not talking about cells that <i>hold values</i>; we're
          talking about cells that hold monotonically-increasing <i>information
          about values</i>.</p>
          <p>How does this apply to the idea of a switch?</p>
          <p>Whereas we would normally think of a switch as being in some state
          at a given time (on or off) simply because “that's the state it's in,”
          the idea here is that, while it might appear that the state of the
          switch can be directly changed, the switch's state is really
          derivative of any number of factors, only one of which is our
          manipulation.  This switch in this case represents the truth of some
          proposition on which other knowledge weighs.

          <blockquote><b>Reason maintenance</b> is a knowledge representation
          approach to efficient handling of inferred information that is
          explicitly stored.  Reason maintenance distinguishes between base
          facts, which can be defeated, and derived facts. As such it differs
          from belief revision which, in its basic form, assumes that all facts
          are equally important. </blockquote>
