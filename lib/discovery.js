/*

GOAL: Built-in directive to start a view with the global namespace when no other
directive is provided.
- you can always get back to this
- the notation can be customized
  - but you can always fall back to the built-in

QUESTIONS:
- where is this information?
  - it's within the global namespace itself
  - on an IRI-based key pointing to meld
  - meld looks to this key for directives &c
