      <h1>dynamic html for the twenty-first century</h1>
      <p>This document is about making plain HTML into a literate programming
      platform.</p>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>This project will create an HTML document that offers the following
        capabilities:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>the document does the expected thing for common actions</li>
          <li>the foundation is sufficient to build more powerful tools</li>
          <li>the mechanisms used support persistence and portability</li>
          <li>support a modular form of composition using external resources</li>
          <li>support the breaking up of script execution units into physical
          pieces</li>
          <li>whatever code is needed to get this up and running can be “tucked
          away” into a section (like an appendix) of this document that is
          normally hidden.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Most of these features have some analog in literate programming
        systems such as Emacs' <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>.</p>

        <h2>What next?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Right now, any changes that you make don't actually persist.</li>

        <h2>Built-in capabilities : what we get “for free”</h2>
        
        <p>In this section, we look at (yes, <em>look at</em>) the web
        platform's <em>built-in</em> capabilities supporting dynamic documents.
        While they are not sufficient for all of our needs, we can use these
        features with minimal effort and build on them.</p>
        
        <p>By “free” I mean “without script.”  If we have to implement it
        ourselves, it's not free.</p>
        
        <section id="make-invisible-elements-visible">
          <h3>Free element visibility</h3>
        
          <p>Things are not real until we can see them.  So the first order of
          business is to <a href="#make-invisible-elements-visible">make
          invisible elements visible</a>. (See also the appendix <a
          href="#markup-versus-programming">“Markup languages <i>versus</i>
          programming languages”</a>) </p>

          <p>We're about to introduce a style rule that makes scripts visible.
          But style rules are also invisible :( So let's do something about
          that.</p>
          
          <style contenteditable="true">
style,
script
{
  display: block;  /* `initial` also works, but gives odd results */
  white-space: pre; /* Preserve whitespace (it's collapsed in normal content) */
}
          </style>

          <p>Many people would also use <code>font-family: monospace</code>, but
          I've been happily coding in proportional fonts for many years.
          Besides, I don't want to write code.</p>
          
          <p>This also goes for the document head and its contents.</p>
          
          <style contenteditable="true">
head, link, title, meta
{
  display: block;
  white-space: pre;
  font-family: monospace;
}
          </style>
          
          <p>In practice, you won't see <code>link</code> or <code>meta</code>
          elements because they have no content (only attributes).</p>
          
        </section>

        <section id="free-content-editability">
          <h3>Free content editability</h3>
          
          <p>The web platform includes a built-in way to make elements editable.
          The global <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable"><code>contenteditable</code></a>
          attribute (which controls the boolean <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/contentEditable"><code>contentEditable</code></a>
          interface property) indicates that “the user” (that's you) should be
          able to type in this area.</p>

          
          <p>Note that “enumerated” attributes are enabled when the value is
          <code>true</code> or the empty string.</p>
          
          <p>Amazingly, making a <code>style</code> block
          <code>contenteditable</code> will immediately reflect changes that
          you make.  (Tested in Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.)</p>
          
          <p>Go ahead, try it.</p>
          
          <style contenteditable="true">
body {
  color: black; /* edit this to set the document's default text color */
}
          </style>
          house rule?
          <style contenteditable="true">
textarea { width: 100%; }
          </style>
          
          <p>You can also make <code>script</code> tags editable.  However, they
          are <em>not</em> re-evaluated when edited.</p>
          
          <script contenteditable="true">
            console.log("mind blown");
          </script>

          <p>Most elements, including <code>style</code>, will inherit the
          <code>contentEditable</code> property, all the way up to the
          <code>html</code> (document).  Some elements (to wit,
          <code>title</code>) do not inherit this property, but are only
          editable when they are explicitly marked as such.</p>

          <section>
            <h4>Indicating when elements are editable</h4>
            
            <p>How can you tell when something is editable, other than trying it?</p>
            
            <p>If the browser lets you put your cursor into a regular text
            element (i.e. a place that is not a text input), then it's
            editable.</p>
            
            <p>It would be useful if we could provide additional visual cues
            that something can be edited.  Here is a rule that targets elements
            with the <code>contenteditable</code> property set.</p>
            
            <style contenteditable="true">
[contenteditable=""],
[contenteditable="true"]
{
  background-color: #FFC;
}
</style>

            <p>Because <code>contenteditable</code> is inherited (in most
            cases), we cannot reliably indicate editability on individual
            elements using CSS.  CSS can only target <em>explicit attribute
            values</em>, not <em>effective property values</em>.  However, we
            can use a CSS property that is itself inherited (such as
            <code>background-color</code>).</p>
            
            <p>Editability can also be turned <em>off</em>.  To prevent
            non-editable elements from inheriting the indicator, we can reset
            them to their initial value.</p>

            <style contenteditable="true">
[contenteditable=""] [contenteditable="false"],
[contenteditable="true"] [contenteditable="false"]
{
  background-color: initial;
}
            </style>
            
          </section>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Free persistence</h3>
          
          <p>By “persistence,” I mean “portability”: the ability to preserve the
          document in whatever state it's in, pick it up, take it somewhere
          else, and pick up where you left off.  For that, we get nothing at all
          for free from the browser.  Even worse: we get a problem.</p>
          
          <section>
            <h4>The “Save” problem</h4>
            
            <p>Once upon a time, browsers had a built-in “Save” feature, and
            that “Save” feature would include changes that the user had made to
            <a href="#free-content-editability">content-editable
            elements</a>.</p>

            <p>That is no longer the case.  As of 2019, <a
            href="#edge-no-save">Microsoft Edge does not have a “Save” feature
            at all</a>, and browsers that do <a href="#lost-free-persistence">do
            not preserve dynamic edits</a>.</p>

            <aside>I have not checked for a “Save” feature in Safari, or on any
            mobile browsers.</aside>

            <p>In a way, it would be better if browsers <em>didn't</em> have a
            built-in save.  It creates certain expectations, yet it's not a
            standard and we (authors) can't control what it does.  In that
            sense, Edge is the first browser to get this right.</p>
            
            <p>As such, the problem becomes, how do we deal with the expectations
            created by a built-in “Save” feature when it does exist?</p>

        <h2>Extending the built-in capabilities</h2>

        <section>
          <h2>the bootstrapper</h2>
          
          <p>This can be accomplished with a surprisingly small
          bootstrapper.</p>
          
          <p>Find all designated script tags.  The timeout is to wait until the
          script has loaded.</p>
          
          <script>
            window.setTimeout(() => {
            for (const script of document.querySelectorAll('[data-autoexec="true"]'))
            eval(script.innerText || script.value);
            }, 1);
          </script>
          
          <textarea data-autoexec="true">
            console.log("hey Tremé!!!!")
          </textarea>
          
          <p>All right, now we should be able to create scripts and edit them
          dynamically just by adding the <code>data-autoexec</code> attribute to a
          <code>textarea</code>.</p>
          
          <textarea data-autoexec="true">
            console.log("gee isn't there anything I can do besides console log?? :(");

          <h3>Markup languages <i>versus</i> programming languages</h3>
          
          <p>Perhaps the most wonderful thing about HTML is that what you write
          is <em>visible by default</em>.  Whatever you type will be output
          (more or less) as you typed it.  For example, an HTML file containing
          nothing but the following eleven characters</p>

          <pre>hello world</pre>

          <p>will, when opened in a web browser, display the text “hello world”
          as expected.  Here, <a target="_blank" download="hello-world.html"
          href="data:text/html, hello world"> try it</a></p>
          
          <p>More realistically, look at the code for this section's opening
          paragraph:</p>
          
          <pre>
            &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most wonderful thing about HTML is that
            what you write is &lt;em&gt;visible by default&lt;/em&gt;.  Whatever
            you type will be output (more or less) as you typed it.  For
            example, an HTML file containing nothing but the following eleven
            bytes&lt;/p&gt;
          </pre>
          
          <aside><b>Note:</b> You can use “view source” in your browser to see
          the markup for this entire document.</aside>
          
          <p>Most of the text is displayed as-is, just like writing on paper.
          This is true generally of “markup” languages.  You have to go out of
          your way to switch to a mode where text is not taken literally.  (In
          the case of HTML, the notorious “angle brackets” are the signal.)</p>
          
          <p>This “literal” quality is also true of spreadsheets: just about
          anything you type into a spreadsheet cell will be displayed in the
          cell just as you typed it.</p>
          
          <p>This see-what-you-typed quality of markup languages may be hard to
          appreciate until you've used something that <em>doesn't</em> work that
          way—such as nearly every programming language.</p>
          
          <p>In “programming” languages, by contrast, the code that you provide
          is <em>not</em> displayed, only interpreted.  You have to go out of
          your way to produce output.</p>
          
          <p>People find markup languages much more intuitive than programming
          languages.  No doubt this quality is a major reason for the web's
          initial success.  Invisiblity is the <em>exception</em> rather than
          the rule.</p>

          <section>
            <h4>Invisible elements in HTML</h4>
            
            <p>Still, there are exceptions.  In HTML, all “tags” (such as the
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags indicating “paragraph”) are themselves
            invisible, as are their attributes.  Instead, the tags impact
            <em>how</em> the text content is displayed.  (More strictly
            speaking, markup helps <em>classify</em> the content, which in turn
            can subject the content to special display rules.) </p>
            
            <p>But for some HTML elements, even the <em>content</em> is
            invisible by default.  These elements include the document
            <code>head</code> (and everything inside it, such as
            <code>title</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>meta</code>, etc),
            <code>style</code>, and <code>script</code>, as well as some newer
            elements like <code>template</code> (whose main purpose is to
            support the “semantic” inclusion of content that is used only by
            scripts).</p>
            
            <p>Considering that some of these invisible elements—particularly
            <code>style</code> and <code>script</code>—are the only way to
            format the document or model changes to it, bringing these elements
            to light is clearly a first step in making any dynamic document
            system.  (<a href="#despecialization">Historical note)</a></p>

          <h3>The despecialization of special elements</h3>
          
          <p>In the old days, elements like <code>head</code>,
          <code>style</code>, and <code>script</code> were specially excluded
          from rendering.  At some point, for consistency's sake, browsers
          started treating these “special” elements just like anything else for
          display purposes.  Now, these invisible elements are simply hidden
          with default rules that set their <code>display</code> property to
          <code>none</code>, which is easily overridden.  (Citation needed.  But
          I'm willing to bet this is the case.)</p>

          <p>These grievances (whose “workarounds” reminded me of a <a
          href="http://wyorock.com/excelasadatabase.htm">Rory Blyth cartoon</a>)
          express just how painfully our computing platform fails to meet basic
          expectations of portability.</p>

          <p>I am quite sure that it used to be the case, that when you would
          save a document wherein you had made changes to content-editable
          elements, those changes would be included in the saved version.</p>
          
          <p>Unfortunately, as of this writing, those browsers that that still
          have a “Save” feature do <em>not</em> include changes that you made to
          editable elements.  This is true regardless of whether you save the
          page as “Complete” or “HTML only” (the claims in <a
          href="https://superuser.com/a/823165">this post</a> notwithstanding.
          It appears that browsers did save changes to contenteditable elements
          as recently as 2014 (<a
          href="https://www.encodedna.com/2014/03/convert-your-browser-into-a-notepad-html5-contenteditable.htm">as
          described here</a>), but this is no longer the case in any browser I
          have.)</p>
