# Helper functions

I've avoided making a “helpers” (or “utilities”) package, because such a thing
is not meaningful.  Yet here are a few things that I use everywhere.  I will
endeavor to come up with a not-completely-arbitrary criteria for inclusion.
Mostly they are simple, pure functions that happen to have strong typing.

**NOTE**: the name of this packages will change when I decide that criteria.

**NOTE**: This package must not take any dependencies.
