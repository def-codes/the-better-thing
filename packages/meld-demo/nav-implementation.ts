/*

 So we
 - override a default behavior of the browser
   - by interpreting a stream of hashtags
     - that we presume is fed by the user's visitation
       - or something authorized by the user

 - assert the name of that hashtag as being linked by representations of these events.
 -
 - reify the events (hashchange)
 - render something with anchor links to real or imaginable things in that model.
 - whether the thing "existed" or not, before, it will be represented.
 - then we can at least talk about it
   - and listen to it.

   - we presume intelligent things come with messages that we will at best
     partially understand.

   - listening, paying attention, trying to get the most out of those alien
     heralds.  Be at rest.
