// ingress is for creating streams
// they don't entail anything
// you provide a stream source
// technically they can be written to
// but ontologically they are understood as not derivative
// and they cannot themselves apply transforms
// also note the description of them is going to include a function
// so it won't be datafiable as such
// also will likely close over some concrete thing or instance
// I mean do you need to make special adapters for every kind of ingress?
