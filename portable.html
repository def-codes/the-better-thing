            Implementation — how it works
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>In this section we work out the details of how portability can be
            supported given the constraints and capabilities.</p>
            <p>Ideally, we could just say “make the document portable.”  More
            specifically, that could mean, “make sure that when you save the
            document, it contains everything that it needs.”  Even more
            specifically, that could mean, “anything that the document fetches
            from a remote server should be pulled into the document itself in
            such a way that future requests obtain the local copy instead of
            looking for a remote.”  This latter operation is what we call
            “inlining.”</p>
            <p>Even more ideally, we would like this capability to be
            independent from any other features, such as <em>literate
            programming</em>.  However, we will see that the two cannot be
            completely separated [citation needed].</p>
            <p>Yet another consideration is the notion of <em>visible</em>
            scripts.  I'm starting to think that this is actually more
            fundamental than portability.  Indeed, the buiding blocks of
            literate programming may be as well.  This would put us in the
            position of the following tradeoff:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>visibility (reification) of scripts is available even before a
              module loader.</li>
              <li>BUT, therefore such visibility cannot be modularized (at least
              not to externals).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Does this make intuitive sense?  If visibility is just about
            visibility of embedded scripts, then I don't see much conflict
            there.  We're talking about dealing with content that's already
            inside the document, so remote scripts don't come into play.
            Dealing with content that comes from remote sources can be seen as
            an extension of basic visibility mechanisms.  For literate
            mechanisms, it's less clear; I'd have to define exactly what I
            meant.</p>
            <p>Finally comes the question of integration with existing
            workflows.  For example, how do we best integrate modules that are
            <em>defined</em>externally—i.e. whose authoritative source is an
            external package—so that they are also naturally embedded into a
            document?  There is an integrity id, there are RDFa attributes, and
            all sorts of things.  It's another entire topic.  I just want to
            keep it in mind when working on these other things.</p>
            <section>
              <h3>Some relevant facts</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>In standalone mode, you can't get get the source of external
                scripts.  So, once the document has left a hosting context, it's
                not possible to independently obtain the content of a
                script—even one that the document loaded.</li>
                <li>(Not so much a fact as the conclusion of an argument that I
                don't actually work out.) It's not possible to shim a generic
                AMD loader in a way that captures the dependency tree.  Even if
                you completely wrap the <code>define</code> function, you cannot
                associate an incoming <em>anonymous</em> definition with the
                module ID that was resolved to require it.  Proof left to the
                reader.  The @def.codes AMD loader provides hooks that make this
                possible.</li>
              </ul>

        <h2>What do we mean by “portability”?</h2>
        <p>People already have tools for working with files.  The more you can
        do with a single file, the more leverage you get from those tools.</p>
        <aside>How many of these concerns are separable?</aside>
        <section>
          <h3>goals</h3>
          <p>Basically what I want is a portable, customizable computing
          environment.  Persisting changes is a necessary piece of that.</p>
          <p>With the tools provided by this package, it should be possible to
          provide (either standalone or hosted) an HTML file with the following
          properties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A custom “save” option is available that prompts you to download
            the document in its current state.</li>
            <li>AMD loader is always available.</li>
            <li>Support “literate” programming (dynamic, visible script blocks)
            <aside>I think what I mean here and below is “userland reification”
            of script blocks, which may be orthogonal to this purpose</aside>
            </li>
            <li>Support visible script blocks even for these support
            scripts</li>
            <li>Remote (AMD) modules that were referenced will still load in
            (custom) saved version.</li>
            <li>make it possible for scripts (external or inline) to define and
            use content provided by inline scripts.  Basically, support AMD
            define.</li>
            <li>Dependencies of remote (AMD) scripts that were referenced will
            still load in (custom) saved version.</li>
            <li>Preserve dynamic modification of stylesheets</li>
            <li>Support going <em>back</em> into hosted mode from standalone
            mode (e.g. to get access to network API's)</li>
            <li>Custom save will retain changes to DOM made by scripts (not
            including iframes...?)</li>
            <li>support development of scripts as external modules (even when
            they're intended for inlining), in other words even though the
            browser should be a viable development environment, it shouldn't be
            <em>required</em> to develop portable content there.</li>
            <li>custom configuration of e.g. requirejs still works (??)</li>
            <li>You can load modules dynamically</li>
            <li>When saving either a standalone or hosted file using the custom
            save function, all of these properties are preserved.</li>
            <li>When saving either type using browser built-in... what
            guarantees can we make?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>non-goals</h3>
          <p>While some of the following may be technically possible, they are
          not priorities for this package:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>inlining of raster images</li>
            <li>inlining of fonts</li>
            <li>inlining of scripts that are not AMD modules</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>inlining</h3>
          <p><dfn>Inline</dfn> content is included directly in the document.
          Inline content travels with the document and remains available even
          when offline.</p>
          <p>WHAT DO IT LOOK LIKE???</p>
          <p>Here, <dfn>“inline”</dfn> is also used to refer to <em>state</em>
          that may be persisted with the HTML.</p>
          <p>WHAT DO THAT LOOK LIKE???</p>
          <p>
            Inlined content may itself refer to (import) external sources.  Such
            second-order imports are only inlined when they are loaded through
            the AMD loader mechanism.
          </p>
          <p>HTML documents of course travel with their textual content.  It is
          considered the main thing.  Indeed, it is the only thing that we can
          consider to be part of the userland model of an HTML document, because
          everything beyond the content is invisible by default.</p>

            <p>
              When everything in a computer system is visible on the screen, the
              display becomes reality.  Objects and actions can be understood
              purely in terms of their effects on the display.

          <p>Some document extensions are portable “for
          free.”  Documents already travel with</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked=""/>
              Content of scripts that were inlined to begin with
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked="" />
              Content of stylesheets that were inlined to begin with
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Custom save <em>inlines</em> the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked="" />
              Remote stylesheets that were referenced by <code>link</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked="" />
              Edits made in <code>contenteditable</code> sections
              <p>See example <a href="#contenteditable">here</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" />
              Checked state of checkboxes
              
              <p>Looks like this has to be done in a preprocess.  The state of
              the input is not reflected in attributes when the DOM is
              serialized.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" />
              Content of form fields generally (may need to split up by type as
              with checkbox)
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked="" />
              Open/closed state of summary/details
              <p>See example <a href="#summary-details">here</a></p>
              <p>(Appears this happens automatically with serialization)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" />
              Content of inline stylesheets that were added dynamically

          <h3>degrees of portability</h3>
          <p>If you're willing to assume internet access, then you can get a
          degree of portability without having to inline everything.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>inventory dependencies</h3>
          <p>We could inventory <em>some</em> of the external resources
          referenced by the document, but not all of them:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>dependencies of scripts (imports, required dependencies)</li>
            <li>dependencies of stylesheets (anything referenced by URL or
            @import)</li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p>Once a document has been saved as HTML, it may be too late to
          recover certain aspects of the original.  This package provides
          facilities for coping with that situation in advance, but depending on
          how the document was saved and how it's being viewed (i.e. over file
          protocol), some of the resources it used may no longer be
          available.</p>

        <h2>Some of the reasons why this isn't easy</h2>
        <h3>i.e. why built-in save don't cut it</h3>
        <section>
          <h3>not all browsers actually seem to <em>have</em> a “Save”
          feature</h3>
          <p>I'm looking at you, Edge.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Not all built-in “Save” features work the same</h3>
          <p>There's no specification for it, so we can't count on them working
          a certain way.  Insert details about how wildly different they
          are as of this writing.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Built-in save doesn't include dynamic changes</h3>
          <p>Or at least, not all the ones we're interested in.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Built-in save isn't extensible.</h3>
          <p>As long as we're making our own “save” functionality, we might as
          well also admit that we can't anticipate everything that it will need
          to do.  Let's make it a protocol so that other things can extend
          it.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Standalone HTML files can't make arbitrary fetches</h3>
          <p>Because of this little restriction, the document has to have
          already taken a number of measures to support portability before
          getting out of the gate.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Script can't read the content of scripts they've loaded.</h3>
          <p>This is just one more annoyance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Support dynamically-loaded remote scripts</h3>
          <p>In a live environment, we need to load remote scripts that
          themselves have dependencies.</p>
          <p>This package supports the dynamic loading of NPM packages
          supporting AMD (and thus UMD) loaders from a (presumably configurable)
          well-known CDN.  d3-require is prior art.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Example usage</h2>
        <p>This document includes some scripts that demonstrate the working of
        the various portability techniques.</p>
        <p>Like, let's add a script that creates a table of contents from the
        structure of the document.  That runs on startup.  If that was done by
        an externally-loaded script, then the saved document should have it
        inlined.</p>
        <p>Let's also have something that exercises the
        find-it-in-the-state-you-left-it thing.</p>
        <p>Exercise the extension mechanism by preserving the textareas</p>
      </section>

        <h2>how to use it</h2>
        <p>What do authors have to do to take advantage of this?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>embed an amd loader</li>
          <li>generally, use AMD</li>
          <li>load or embed the portability module</li>
