        <h2>What do we mean by “portability”?</h2>
        <p>People already have tools for working with files.  The more you can
        do with a single file, the more leverage you get from those tools.</p>
        <aside>How many of these concerns are separable?</aside>
        <section>
          <h3>goals</h3>
          <p>Basically what I want is a portable, customizable computing
          environment.  Persisting changes is a necessary piece of that.</p>
          <p>With the tools provided by this package, it should be possible to
          provide (either standalone or hosted) an HTML file with the following
          properties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A custom “save” option is available that prompts you to download
            the document in its current state.</li>
            <li>AMD loader is always available.</li>
            <li>Support “literate” programming (dynamic, visible script blocks)
            <aside>I think what I mean here and below is “userland reification”
            of script blocks, which may be orthogonal to this purpose</aside>
            </li>
            <li>Support visible script blocks even for these support
            scripts</li>
            <li>Remote (AMD) modules that were referenced will still load in
            (custom) saved version.</li>
            <li>make it possible for scripts (external or inline) to define and
            use content provided by inline scripts.  Basically, support AMD
            define.</li>
            <li>Dependencies of remote (AMD) scripts that were referenced will
            still load in (custom) saved version.</li>
            <li>Preserve dynamic modification of stylesheets</li>
            <li>Support going <em>back</em> into hosted mode from standalone
            mode (e.g. to get access to network API's)</li>
            <li>Custom save will retain changes to DOM made by scripts (not
            including iframes...?)</li>
            <li>support development of scripts as external modules (even when
            they're intended for inlining), in other words even though the
            browser should be a viable development environment, it shouldn't be
            <em>required</em> to develop portable content there.</li>
            <li>custom configuration of e.g. requirejs still works (??)</li>
            <li>You can load modules dynamically</li>
            <li>When saving either a standalone or hosted file using the custom
            save function, all of these properties are preserved.</li>
            <li>When saving either type using browser built-in... what
            guarantees can we make?</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h3>non-goals</h3>
          <p>While some of the following may be technically possible, they are
          not priorities for this package:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>inlining of raster images</li>
            <li>inlining of fonts</li>
            <li>inlining of scripts that are not AMD modules</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>inlining</h3>
          <p><dfn>Inline</dfn> content is included directly in the document.
          Inline content travels with the document and remains available even
          when offline.</p>
          <p>WHAT DO IT LOOK LIKE???</p>
          <p>Here, <dfn>“inline”</dfn> is also used to refer to <em>state</em>
          that may be persisted with the HTML.</p>
          <p>WHAT DO THAT LOOK LIKE???</p>
          <p>
            Inlined content may itself refer to (import) external sources.  Such
            second-order imports are not inlined.
          </p>
          <p>Custom save <em>inlines</em> the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked=""/>
              Content of scripts that were inlined to begin with
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked="" />
              Content of stylesheets that were inlined to begin with
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked="" />
              Remote stylesheets that were referenced by <code>link</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked="" />
              Edits made in <code>contenteditable</code> sections
              <p>See example <a href="#contenteditable">here</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" />
              Checked state of checkboxes
              
              <p>Looks like this has to be done in a preprocess.  The state of
              the input is not reflected in attributes when the DOM is
              serialized.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" />
              Content of form fields generally (may need to split up by type as
              with checkbox)
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked="" />
              Open/closed state of summary/details
              <p>See example <a href="#summary-details">here</a></p>
              <p>(Appears this happens automatically with serialization)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" />
              Content of inline stylesheets that were added dynamically
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h3>degrees of portability</h3>
          <p>If you're willing to assume internet access, then you can get a
          degree of portability without having to inline everything.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>inventory dependencies</h3>
          <p>We could inventory <em>some</em> of the external resources
          referenced by the document, but not all of them:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>dependencies of scripts (imports, required dependencies)</li>
            <li>dependencies of stylesheets (anything referenced by URL or
            @import)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p>Once a document has been saved as HTML, it may be too late to
          recover certain aspects of the original.  This package provides
          facilities for coping with that situation in advance, but depending on
          how the document was saved and how it's being viewed (i.e. over file
          protocol), some of the resources it used may no longer be
          available.</p>
        </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Some of the reasons why this isn't easy</h2>
        <h3>i.e. why built-in save don't cut it</h3>
        <section>
          <h3>not all browsers actually seem to <em>have</em> a “Save”
          feature</h3>
          <p>I'm looking at you, Edge.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Not all built-in “Save” features work the same</h3>
          <p>There's no specification for it, so we can't count on them working
          a certain way.  Insert details about how wildly different they
          are as of this writing.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Built-in save doesn't include dynamic changes</h3>
          <p>Or at least, not all the ones we're interested in.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Built-in save isn't extensible.</h3>
          <p>As long as we're making our own “save” functionality, we might as
          well also admit that we can't anticipate everything that it will need
          to do.  Let's make it a protocol so that other things can extend
          it.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Standalone HTML files can't make arbitrary fetches</h3>
          <p>Because of this little restriction, the document has to have
          already taken a number of measures to support portability before
          getting out of the gate.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Script can't read the content of scripts they've loaded.</h3>
          <p>This is just one more annoyance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Support dynamically-loaded remote scripts</h3>
          <p>In a live environment, we need to load remote scripts that
          themselves have dependencies.</p>
          <p>This package supports the dynamic loading of NPM packages
          supporting AMD (and thus UMD) loaders from a (presumably configurable)
          well-known CDN.  d3-require is prior art.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Example usage</h2>
        <p>This document includes some scripts that demonstrate the working of
        the various portability techniques.</p>
        <p>Like, let's add a script that creates a table of contents from the
        structure of the document.  That runs on startup.  If that was done by
        an externally-loaded script, then the saved document should have it
        inlined.</p>
        <p>Let's also have something that exercises the
        find-it-in-the-state-you-left-it thing.</p>
        <p>Exercise the extension mechanism by preserving the textareas</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>how to use it</h2>
        <p>What do authors have to do to take advantage of this?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>embed an amd loader</li>
          <li>generally, use AMD</li>
          <li>load or embed the portability module</li>
          <li>make a save link</li>
          <li>and wire it to the save function</li>
        </ul>
